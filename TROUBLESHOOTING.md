# Troubleshooting

## Dependencies

### Truffle

Truffle on you host should be at the correct version that is compatible with `openzeppelin-solidity ^1.10.0`

### Web3

Web3 version should be the same between DApp and Protocol. Different versions are not compatible. Until now version is downgraded due protocol at `^1.0.0-beta.46`

## Metamask

### Error: the tx doesn't have the correct nonce.

To fix this error you should reset your Metamask Account.

Just click on your account avatar, then go to _Settings > Advanced > **Reset Account**_

After this operation try again your transaction and now the nonce should be calculated correctly.
