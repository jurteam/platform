## Deployment
```
constructor(address _jurToken)
```
The address used to deploy the contract **OathKeeper.sol** automatically becomes the owner/admin of the contract.
1. **_jurToken** - The JUR Token address


## Write methods
### 1. Adding an oath
```
takeAnOath(uint _lockInPeriod)
```
Any JUR token holder can give allowance to the Oath Keeper for the amount of tokens they want to lock and then call this
function to lock the tokens for a chosen time period. One address can only lock the tokens multiple times.
1. **_lockInPeriod** - Number of months (integer) to lock the tokens for

### 2. Releasing an oath
```
releaseOath(uint _id)
```
Once the lock-in period is over, the owner of the locked tokens can call this function to release the tokens from the oath
and receive them in their designated address by providing the array index of the oath related to the address.
1. **_id** - The array index of the oath related to the address

### 3. Updating minimum and maximum lock-in duration requirements
```
updateLockPeriod(uint _minimumLockPeriod, uint _maximumLockPeriod) 
```
The owner of the contract can update the minimum and maximum lock-in duration requirements of the contract. This is set in terms of months. The default values are 1 to 36 months.
