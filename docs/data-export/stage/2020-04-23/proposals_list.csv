65,"1. The Seller did not comply with the obligations set forth in Article 4.1. of the Contract. More specifically, the goods delivered were evidently not fit for resale (the established purpose for
which the goods were being sold, as per Article 4.1.2). Clearly, the claimant will not be able to resell four of the books as several pages within each book are missing. Moreover, Schwarz
clearly and reasonably expected such books to be in a condition proper for normal use of such books. The claimant argues that these books serve no purpose if not all the pages are there.

2. The Seller had every intention of selling defective books by purposefully tearing up pages in the middle and end of books, in order for the defect not to be perceived at first glance.
3. The defect arising out of conformity existed at the time of delivery, thus the seller should be fully liable.
4. The buyer also claims damage to its business by not being able to provide his loyal customers with readings that would have greatly expanded the knowledge of whoever wished to read
such fascinating books.
5. Moreover, whether the defect appeared because of the delivery service’s fault does not exclude the Seller’s liability.

71,"The claimant argues that they signed a contract for the delivery of the products within a
week from 07/03/2020- when the demand for these products was at its highest- to ensure they
had the necessary supplies to face the COVID-19 epidemic. Now, 98 days from the signing of
the contract, the epidemic is over. The claimant refuses to accept the products now as they no
longer need such a large amount. They believe the respondent caused them irreversible
economic damage because they were the only pharmacy in Segovia who did not have masks
and hand sanitizers at a time of high demand. This resulted in a massive loss of profit for them.
Due to the longevity of the waiting period, the claimant was under the impression that the
respondent would not fulfill their end of the contract.
The claimant believes that the long delay caused them irreversible and catastrophic
economic damage. The respondent did not deliver within six working days and was late enough
to give the impression they will never deliver. Consequently, the claimant believes that under
clause 9.4, the respondent is liable to pay a maximum of X JUR (6,200 EUR). This compensatory amount
corresponds to the profit they would have made from the sale of the products, had they arrived
at the expected time (between the 08/03/2020- 15/03/2020), as well as the amount they paid for
the products. The 20% discount is not enough to compensate them for the loss they incurred

circumstances.
They believe the claimant should accept the products (since they fulfill all the
manufacturing clauses) and be given a 20% discount, as indicated under clause 9.2. If they do
not accept the order, they should compensate the respondent for the cost (including the taxes)
they incurred during the manufacturing process. Additionally, under Breach Of Contract, the
contract only refers to a 20% discount in case of delay (clause 9.2) and failure of delivery

74,"On Monday the 16th of March at 19:00 pm the Test Kits were loaded on to a truck in Madrid and ready to be delivered to Calle San Facundo 3, Segovia, Segovia, 40001, Spain, Sweet Home Segovia ́s address. The driver, Juan Carlos, who has been employed by Mrs. Diaz for the past 3 years, was involved in a severe vehicle accident on his way to delivery. Luckily Mr Carlos did not suffer any physical injuries, three test kits, however, were completely destroyed and the other seven were partially damaged putting their reliability and accuracy into question. Mr Carlos, a former member of an AA group (Alcoholics Anonymous), was forced by the police at the accident scene to take a Breathalyzer test. The alcohol concentration in Mr Carlos ́blood was indeed higher than 0.5 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood (the legal drinking limit in Spain). These same Covid 19 Test Kits were delivered to Sweet Home Segovia on the 18th of March, one day later than the date agreed upon in the contract, hence causing substantial losses to Sweet Home Segovia who had promised its leaseholders working Covid-19 test Kids by the 17th of March.

Sweet Home Segovia claims that Gema Beidas Diaz should be accounted responsible and therefore pay for all losses incurred by Sweet Home Segovia caused by the delay in the delivery as well as their lack of performance. Additionally, Sweet Home Segovia refuses to acquire the title to and risks the loss of the Goods as stated in clause 4.2 in the agreement signed by the two parties.
Claimant’s evidence: Sweet Home Segovia bases its argument on Juan Carlos ́ medical record which reveals his previous alcohol addiction and therefore proves that this incident was foreseeable and could have been avoided by the seller since Juan Carlos is employed by Mrs. Diaz. It is Mrs. Diaz ́s duty as an employer to know about Juan Carlos ́s medical condition considering they have worked together for the past three years.

77,"Christopher Leaner did not comply with clause 5.2 (d). He should have informed us that the trash containers were going to be full such that we could have prevented it, on the contrary he deposited the extra trash out of the containers without notifying. This behaviour amounts an infringement of the contract and at the same time it provoked the municipality to sanction us. 
Geolocation indications are missing.
In light of the above, the overall quality is lower than the price paid, so we ask for a price reduction. The reduction also take into account the economic value of the fine.

78,"I agree in that the extra trash was placed outside of the containers. However, I was asked to clean the inside not the outside of the building, and that one Monday I found way more trash in the cans inside the building with respect to the usual. Since I never had problems any other week, I never took action according to clause 3.2d, which would have been calling the customer and notify to empty the containers. Last week, the level of the trash in the containers was not different from the usual, and I did not feel the urge to notify anything. Finally, I thought leaving the extra trash outside of the building complies better with the service specified in my contract, as opposed to leaving the extra trash inside the building.
Geolocation was asked but no actual way of sharing it was proposed and no phone number was shared in order to do it via mobile phone apps.
I therefore acknowledge that only not notifying immediately for the misplacement of the garbage was a mistake, but nothing else, and I would accept a fair reduction of the price for the service: 
95%.

In light of the above, I am asking for a fair reduction of the price, as now we do not have time left in the contract to adjust the trend.

81,"It is true that Borrel requested to improve the quality of the work. Therefore, I fixed the work, and I informed Borrel in written form during the 6th month about the fixes that I made, as requested under clause 4.4 of the contract. However, according to this same clause, Borrel was expected to re-evaluate the remedy provided by the me at the earliest opportunity and he was supposed to approve or reject the remedy in the same way I was informed about the rectification, hence in written form. I sent my communication in the agreed shared folder https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FjGCPZYCxidovuNRWKd0UIVKn6HhoYuE, but Borrel never replied. As the voters can see, there is no re-evaluation from Borrel here. So I reasonably assumed that Borrel was fine with my work. This behavior is not in good faith. It is clear to me that Borrel is using its silence as a sneaky way to reduce the price.
