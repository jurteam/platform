Further, the Jur platform may encounter difficulties during development, including financial, resourcing and technical difficulties. These difficulties are unpredictable and may be unresolvable and may compromise the overall development. Services which may be banned, restricted in certain jurisdictions may potentially use the Jur platform. As a result, governmental authorities or regulators may take action against the Jur platform. This may deter users from using the Jur platform or may involve the complete shutdown of the Jur platform. The laws of various jurisdictions may apply to the Jur platform. The application of these laws and regulations to the Jur platform is, in many cases, largely untested, and is subject to change without notice. Jur may receive formal or informal queries, notices, requests or warnings by governmental authorities and regulators. Action may be taken by governmental authorities and regulators against Jur or the Jur platform. As a result of such events, Jur may be required to discontinue the Jur platform or provide any other such information related to the same. The Jur platform rely heavily on the internet. However, the public nature of the internet means that either parts of the internet or the entire internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Further, interruption, delay, corruption or loss of data, or the loss of confidentiality in the transmission of data, may occur when transmitting data via the internet. The Jur platform rely on a third party blockchain platform. Such a blockchain platform may be open source software that is built upon experimental technology, namely blockchain. Risks arising from this reliance include (but are not limited to): the existence of technical flaws in such a blockchain platform; targeting of such a blockchain platform by malicious persons; changes in such a blockchain platform’s consensus protocol or algorithms; decreased community or miner support for such a blockchain platform; the existence or development of competing networks and platforms; the existence or development of Forked versions of such a blockchain platform; flaws in the Solidity scripting language; disputes between such a blockchain platform developers, miners and/or users; regulatory action against such a blockchain platform developers, miners and/or users. The various source codes used in the Jur platform are subject to change and may at any time contain one or more defects, weaknesses, inconsistencies, errors or bugs. Use of the Jur platform will not be anonymous. Your address and such participation will be recorded on a permissionless blockchain. It is possible to match addresses to identities. Furthermore, to comply with Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations and in accordance with our privacy statements, disclosure will be made to relevant authorities and regulators upon request. The Jur platform may be vulnerable to exploitation of vulnerabilities in smart contracts and other code, as well as to human error. This could result in significant loss and/or other impacts that may materially affect your interests. Potential risks: blockchain-related risks: the underlying software application and software platform is still in an early development stage and unproven so there is no warranty that the process for developing the Jur platform will be uninterrupted or error-free. There is an inherent risk of weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs of the software causing the complete loss of the Jur platform; abandonment/lack of success: Jur may abandon the development of the Jur platform for various reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects) and legal, tax or regulatory considerations; regulatory risks: certain jurisdictions might apply already existing laws and regulations to blockchain technology-based projects or introduce new laws or regulations for this purpose. Newly introduced regulations may differ to the existing setup of the Jur platform. This may cause, inter alia, substantial modifications of the Jur platform.</p><h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2><p>Mere silence, or the absence of a prompt reaction, of Jur in case of any breach of the TTos by you will not be construed as acceptance of the violation or as a waiver of the right to demand fulfillment of the obligation, or as a waiver of the rights and/or powers of Jur. Rights and remedies provided in the TTos are not exclusive but are in addition to those available under the applicable law. Should a provision of the TTos be judged null or invalid by a court or another competent authority, such a provision will be considered erased from the TTos and the remaining provisions will remain effective and valid.</p> <h2>APPLICABLE LAW, JURISDICTION AND COMPETENT COURT</h2> <p>The Parties expressly agree that the TTos is exclusively governed by the Swiss Law without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles. The Parties expressly agree that any disputes regarding the validity, performance, effectiveness or termination of the TTos is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Swiss Court and, in particular, exclusively to the Court of Zug (Switzerland) unless mandatory applicable laws provide otherwise.</p>';
